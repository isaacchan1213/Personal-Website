# Personal Website

This is a website I made as an assignment for the fellowship I am working at. This is my first time using Tailwind in a project, which was really cool to learn! I used React as my primary framework and made this entire thing from scratch. Please feel free to check it out! Still working on it, but the entire version one design is now implemented.
